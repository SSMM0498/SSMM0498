# Hi there 👋
##  I'm Serigne Saliou

I'm an AI Enthusiast 🧠, FullStack🌟 Engineer, and passionate about Golang ⚓, VueJS👽, ReactJS🚀, Typescript❤️, Node🍀, ExpressJS🤖, NestJS🧩, .NET💜, and SpringBoot. With a 100% backend start, I love the Golang philosophy, but I prefer using the NodeJS stack for its simplicity and efficiency. My passion for drawing has inspired me to add the frontend as a new string to my bow to bring beautiful designs to life with VueJS.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a challenging project
